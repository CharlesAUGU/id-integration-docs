# Delivery

## Content type

Fractal ID uses `application/json` content type to deliver the JSON payload directly as the body of the `POST` request.

## Expected response

Fractal ID expects your server to reply with response code `2xx` to identify successful delivery. All response codes outside this range, including `3xx` codes, will indicate to Fractal ID that you did not receive the webhook.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fractal ID will make sure to send notification successfully at least once to the client. There is a possibility of receiving the same successful webhook notification multiple times, but in very rare cases. This means you should likely want to ensure your endpoint is idempotent.
{% endhint %}

## Retrying sending notifications

Fractal ID will retry to send webhooks notification if:

* Client server failed to respond in 10 seconds.
* Client server is unavailable \(network errors\).
* Client server returns other response code than `2xx`.

Fractal ID uses exponential backoff to retry events.

### Example retry times table

| Retries | Next retry in seconds |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 20 |
| 2 | 40 |
| 3 | 80 |
| 5 | 320 |
| 10 | 10240 |
| 15 | 86400 |
| 20 | 86400 |
